Openni_launch from kinect

## Cameras
If you are using an integrated webcam, use GSCAM.

You must set GSCAM_CONFIG environment variable (as a rosparam) to use GSCAM. 
Eg: 
 export GSCAM_CONFIG="v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! video/x-raw-rgb ! ffmpegcolorspace" $ rosrun gscam gscam


## Speakers
Use the sound_play node from ros
See: http://wiki.ros.org/sound_play.
We just run this node and use its respective children nodes to communicate with sounds or text. This will give us text synthesis. 

## Microphone
Use Audio_play by ROS
http://wiki.ros.org/audio_common/Tutorials/Streaming%20audio

Use audio_capture by ROS
sudo apt-get install ros-hydro-audio-capture

This will allow you to interact with audio on /audio topic
